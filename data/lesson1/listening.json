          "audio_text": "Sara has been in the Children’s Medical Center for a week. She has caught a terrible flu. The doctor told her to stay there to get better. There is a photograph of an old man on the wall. While the nurse is taking her temperature, they start talking. Sara: Excuse me, who is that man in the picture? Nurse: Oh, don’t you know him? Have you ever heard of Dr. Mohammad Gharib? Sara: I guess I have only seen his name in my English book, but I’m not sure about it. Nurse: Dr. Gharib was a famous physician. Sara: Oh, can you tell me a little about his life? Nurse: Dr. Gharib was born in Tehran in 1288. After receiving his diploma, he went abroad to study medicine. In 1316 he became a physician and then came back to his homeland. In 1347 this center was founded by Dr. Gharib and one of his close friends. Sara: Really? I didn’t know that. Nurse: Dr. Gharib was also a generous man. He spared no pains to cure sick children. He was very friendly and helpful to poor families. Not surprisingly, he was regarded as a dedicated physician. Sara: It’s a pity! I didn’t know such a great man. Nurse: He was known as a distinguished university professor, too. The first Persian textbook on children’s diseases was written by him. He taught medicine to thousands of students. Sara: Oh, what a great man he was! Nurse: By the way, it might be interesting to know that your physician was one of Dr. Gharib’s students! Sara: Really?! That’s interesting!",
