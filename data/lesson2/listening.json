Majid: Excuse me Mr. Iranmehr, I wonder if you could help me. Mr. Iranmehr: Sure. How can I help you? Majid: I’d like some information about a good English dictionary. Mr. Iranmehr: Oh, well. Have you ever used a dictionary? Majid: Actually, I haven’t. But I’ve heard that using a good dictionary can really help me learn English better. Mr. Iranmehr: That’s right. First, I recommend a learner’s dictionary. Majid: What is a learner’s dictionary? Mr. Iranmehr: It is designed for foreign students. It also helps them learn English better. Majid: Is there only one type of it? Mr. Iranmehr: No, in fact dictionaries have different types, levels, and sizes. Majid: What type do you suggest? Mr. Iranmehr: I suppose a monolingual dictionary is more suitable for you, because you can find word information in English. Majid: And what about levels? Mr. Iranmehr: Well, there are usually three levels: elementary, intermediate and advanced. For you as a high school student, an elementary one is OK. Majid: Do I need a small size one? Mr. Iranmehr: Yes, a pocket dictionary. You can carry it wherever you go. Majid: Ohh, it’s very good. And hmm…, is it expensive? Mr. Iranmehr: No, such dictionaries are not expensive. By the way, you can use a free online dictionary, too. And also there are some free dictionaries for PCs and apps for smart phones. Majid: Thanks, that’s a good idea, but I’d like to use a pocket dictionary!",
