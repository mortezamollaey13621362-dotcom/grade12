Emad: I know electricity can be produced from water and sunlight. How might it be generated from wind? Father: Well, a wind turbine works the opposite of a fan. Instead of using electricity to make wind, a turbine uses wind to make electricity. It is a type of clean energy. Emad: These wind turbines remind me of what I read about using wind power in Yazd's buildings. Father: You mean wind towers? Emad: Yes, they are natural air cooling systems and can be used instead of electrical air conditioners. This is another source of clean energy, isn't it? Father: Yes, it is. An excellent type of clean energy! Emad: Daddy, can we travel to Yazd this Norooz? Father: That's OK with me. Let's check it with others.",
